# Alarm

A [Flashlight](http://flashlight.nateparrott.com/) plugin for triggering an
alarm.

Can be used as a regular alarm clock by specifying times you want the
alarm to sound at, but can also be used as a countdown timer by specifying
some time period you want the alarm to sound after.

Allows alarms to be created in a variety of different ways:

    alarm in 20m
    alarm at 4:00PM Time to get kids from school
    alarm at 7:10

Uses an alert and accompanying sound.
